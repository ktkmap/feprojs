          Roast beef is a traditional English dish of beef which is roasted. Essentially prepared as a main meal, the leftovers are often used in sandwiches and sometimes are used to make hash. In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, roast beef is one of the meats traditionally served at Sunday lunch or dinner, although it is also often served as a cold cut in delicatessen stores, usually in sandwiches. A traditional side dish to roast beef is Yorkshire pudding. Roast beef is a signature national dish of England and holds cultural meaning for the English dating back to the 1731 ballad "The Roast Beef of Old England". The dish is so synonymous with England and its cooking methods from the 18th century that a French nickname for the English is "les Rosbifs".

          A flan, in English and other cuisines, is a dish with an open, rimmed pastry or sponge base containing a sweet or savory filling; examples are quiche lorraine, custard tart, and the South African melktert. Flan is known in Roman cuisine. It was often a savory dish, as in "eel flan"; sweet flans were also enjoyed. In the Middle Ages, both sweet and savory flans (almonds, cinnamon & sugar; cheese, curd, spinach, fish) were very popular in Europe, especially during Lent, when meat was forbidden. The English word "flan", and the earlier forms "flaune" and "flawn", come from the Old French flaon (modern French flan), in turn from the early Medieval Latin flad≈çn-em, derived from the Old High German flado, a sort of flat cake, probably from an Indo-European root for "flat" or "broad".
